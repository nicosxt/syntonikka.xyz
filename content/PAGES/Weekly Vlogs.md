### Philosophy

Like many artists I know, I struggle with having really big scopes for projects, and end up never finishing them because of the daunting final result.

But just like climbing a mountain or learning a new language, the only way to get up there is to keep going at it, and a great way to keep on doing is to lower your big goas to incremental challenges.

The Weekly Vlogs help me produce something quickly every week ---- **it is about finishing a project, not about making the best art.** The iterative process itself is a great practice and comes with many learnings such as scope control, effective creativity, storytelling with limited resources and time, etc...
