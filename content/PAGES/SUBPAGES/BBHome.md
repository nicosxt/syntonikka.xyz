# To Do
With limited time and resources, I'm planning to prioritize one space at a time.
##### Pink Trailer
- [ ] sending out an asbestos test
- [ ] shop vac & cleaning
- [ ] ...
##### Outdoor Space
- [ ] take out trash
- [ ] dig out space for composting

##### Big Stuff
- [ ] fix up the back teardrop trailer
- [ ] maybe take out teardrop trailer

### Question to Ponder:
- What are some ways to finance the space & rally muscle to help with cleaning & building? Maybe we can promise free stay in return in the future?
- How can we benefit from rental income & offer creatives open access to utilities?
- What kind of residencies can be hosted out there?
- Name for the place??
