Ever since I started making music, I've had the idea to make an interactive singing city.

Wouldn't it be awesome if you can make a beautiful piece of melody in all sorts of novel, experimental, random way?

The end goal is clear: Make music while playing --- 'Play' music.

In order to be a successful game, a few essential elements have to be here:
1. It is fun to play
2. It sounds amazing
3. It invents things that haven't been invented before.

### Getting Started
Have fallen victim of an infinite scope creep, I've learned lessons of having massive goals and never finishing it, now it doesn't mean that it cannot evolve to be complex, but the basics need to be simple enough so I can launch it all on my own.

I can make sequencers, random physical instruments, a bicycle that sings, a building that sings, everything in this game can have their own rules and principles of making sounds, the sky is the limit!

Eventually it can be a sandbox where player gets to drag and drop any instrument to the scene to make their own 'singing city', but first, maybe we focus on making just one.

### Sequencer
I think the sequencer is a good starting point, because it is easy enough to make and fun already. Although a sequencer doesn't have interesting functions such as ambient pad or dynamic vocal or cool synth effects, it's fun enough on its own. This my first iteration of a sequencer with singing agents.

It is very tempting to want to expand already and play around with something more experimental, advanced, etc... but I need to remind myself: **STAY FOCUSED**

### Long Term Goal
The keyword here is a musical sandbox, it's a sandbox that you can drag and drop and customize, allowing user to create a world of possibilities. Each instrument has their unique capabilities, such as the sequencer, or maybe an apple tree, or maybe who knows, a bicycle rider rolling around hills, or a skate park, anyways... any of these things can be instruments, and player gets to pick them, choose and edit them, in the end put them all together in a scene to make music.

### Simplifying Goal -- Just an AR sequencer
Now the vision has become more clear: an AR sequencer app.
What we're eliminating:
- instruments other than sequenced beats (no pads, no melody yet)
- other experimental instruments.
AR is still a niche and an AR sequencer hasn't been created yet.

### UI/UX in Augmented Reality
Once goal has been simplified, we can move forward with a much clearer direction.
Because it is in AR, UI interactions would be different from a standalone or even mobile experience.
##### Functional buttons in screen space
it is not necessary for user to click a button in AR space, especially when the button needs to be functional, it's just too inconvenient and unnecessary.
##### Playful interactions in AR space
What's special about AR is that it interacts with the environment, user can choose to place the sequencer in real world and see the visuals in real-life space, which is a very one-of-a-kind experience that only AR apps can offer. This would be the special 'cookie' of the game.

### Change of Direction - No Need for AR Game
I've encountered some problems incorporating AR mechanism into the game, mostly the documentation is scarce, I don't have enough engineering knowledge to understand it, and most importantly, I couldn't find enough tutorials online that cover this extensively.

Unity is using XR toolkit for both AR and VR interactions now, but I can barely find any tutorials specific to AR unless they are from 3 years ago. That got me thinking:

Do people even play AR games?

And the answer is very obvious -- no, people do not play AR games, not saying that it shouldn't be made, but the majority of mobile games is NOT AR.

So I decided on a change of direction: instead of AR games, focus on the sequencing, sound and visuals of the game, and just publish it. It doesn't even need to be 3D. It could just be a fun little interface!

**So here's the new strategy:**
- no AR, no 3D for now
- focus on UI
- make it sound amazing and really fun!
