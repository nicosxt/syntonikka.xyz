I was selected as an artist for the Forefront W3CR Art residency, in which I was given 1 month to finish a prototype of an art project.

I decided to create an virtual eco village for [Agartha](https://agartha.one).

### Final Result

### Video Documentation
In this project, I shared many of my creative inspirations and philosophical & ideological struggles in public to participate in the style of #CreateInPublic
I want to give a shoutout to [Forefront](https://www.forefront.market/) for giving me the opportunity to express my creativity and help share it with their audience!
