### Thesis
Scientific quantum discovery revealed the mystical nature of our universe, whether it is organic matter or mechanical inventions, the underlying principle of operation and existence share many layers of similarities -- we are quantum, so are our creations.
This piece is created drawing a metaphor between quantum computing and plants. By using symmetry of 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 (amount of pedals at different layer of the flower), I intend to curate a sense of divine balance and symbolize the geometrical & numerical nature of our universal rules and principles.

The geometry was made with Blender's geometry nodes, lots of curves & adjustments. I'm still getting used to the generative workflow in contrast to traditional modeling, it is definitely the future. The piece is rendered with Unreal Engine, I'm starting to learn it recently and am still getting a hang of how it works, looking forward iterating more pieces.
