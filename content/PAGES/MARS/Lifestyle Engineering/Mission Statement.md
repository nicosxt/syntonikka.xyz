I want to build spaces where creativity, community, and technology catalyzes a movement towards grid-free worlds. 

---

In these worlds, creators bond intimately through collaboration and collective learning, virtual simulations enhance our understanding of reality, art and stories express our complex emotions and ideas. 

By intertwining sustainable living, DIY technological and artistic practices, these worlds aim to inspire and model a protopian future where being off-grid is not only viable but enriches our collective human experience.

Each of these worlds shapes a more connected and empathetic society.
