**WHY**
Through simulating a world, we discover how our world is built, this is the beauty of engineering, because our world is also engineered.

Games are simulations that are abstracted from our natural systems at large. They are these assumptions of a certain scenario applied to familiar (war), adjacently familiar (vampires) elements.

#### Hi Mom our simulations are creating simulations!

We create simulations with a set of foundamental rules and logics while we live in simulations with a set of foundamental rules and logics. 

The universe is fractalling constantly.

Scenes to collect:
Unreal engine world building transition to real life 3D environment

Succession, season 4 ep 1 Logan's monologue about markets
Westworld, monolog about God
simcity, city skylines, 30 years of playing god

### Worlding
What is a world?
A future you can believe in
an ongoing generation of drama
a system with foundamental rules and laws and autonomous agents that obey them

> What is Worlding? Worlding is the artistic activity of an individual artist conceiving, incubating, triggering and nurturing a World towards aliveness

> World's 'aliveness' = evidence usage (social influences) / creator's hold (creative direction control)

Higher creative control = less autonomy of the world

> Life is long and existence is unbearable without a sense of growth towards something

#### Worlds inside our little brains

Internal family system, psychologies and how they can be visualized in 3D recognizable items, Astor visualized with metaphors?

Mulri-personality 'disorders' ---- internal family systems ---- all these personas we have, the origins of our thoughts

The extremes, yin and yang of personalities, and we dance among everything in between.

What is a 'world'. It could be any presence of environment you put yourself in. If you re fully present in the moment,the world is always right in front of you, and everything you engage in is it's own little world.
