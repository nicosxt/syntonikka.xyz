Little Marvi by
Mars College faces challenges in resource management, such as water conservation, energy use, and closing the toilet lid. To tackle this, I introduce Little Marvi, a character designed to encourage mindful resource usage through engaging Public Service Announcements (PSAs). Little Marvi, an extension of the Little Martians universe by #va2rosa, showcases Martians performing responsible actions around Mars. Users can request an image and personalize these messages using a simple, ready to print, Google Slides template. This initiative aligns with the Hackathon's "Worlding" theme by building on the existing Little Martians world and enhancing our IRL world's sustainable practices in a fun, relatable manner. Conclusion: With the help of Little Marvi, we can create fun art that inspires a more mindful culture at Mars College.
