### Reflections
##### Follow-ups
- [x] Make a twitter threads & announcement
##### What worked really well?
Gene: Great in general, low expectation high turn outs
Jmill: Timeline works, projects are coherent, 1 on 1 support is mutually beneficial
##### What can we do better?
- Pre-paration -- announce earlier, people have time to prepare
- Add an art category -- no mega winner, only categories
- get cooking support
- speaker + projector + timer presentation setup ready to go
- feedback & follow ups on projects
- clean up afterwards
- get user's Twitter handle
