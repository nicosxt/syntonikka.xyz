# Worlding

---
"Emissary's Guide to Worlding" is a practical manual by Ian Cheng, focusing on the creation and nurturing of living, dynamic worlds, blending artistry and psychology for immersive world-building

---
'Worlds' in this context are ***digital spaces that have their own rules, behaviors, and elements, which can evolve without direct human control.***

---
### What can 'Worlds' be?
Stories, Systems, Entities, Intelligences
Apps, Games, Simulations
Brands, Merchandises, Businesses
Families, Institutions, Religions, Nations, Cultures...
You get the idea

---
Worlds are **Infinite Games** that can be continued outside of it's developer's control
- Purpose of Worlds = Continue Generating 'Drama'
	1 extreme: Boring Utopia
	-1 extreme: Chaos that Falls Apart
- Aliveness = Evidence Usage / Creator's Hold

---
### Rules are Not Strict!

- Working on existing project is GREAT!
- New features on existing project is GREAT!
- See this as an accountability opportunity is GREAT!
- Create-a-thon!
