Repetition creates consistency
Repetition creates a trans state of consciousness
Repetition creates stairs that build up to greater work
Repetition composes essential parts of life

When you move to a new city, a lot of things have to start over, relationships, companions, know-how and know-what.
Same with starting a new career, a new hobby, you have to inevitably stumble or slow down before you can accelerate.

In order to accelerate to a higher speed, familiarity is required, familiarity comes from consistency, consistency comes from repetition.

One two, one two, just keep going.

Every time you abaondon a hobby, a place, a relationship, a job, everything has to be re-set. Every time you pick up something new, you have to be ready to accept the non-familiarity.

If your life is constantly filled with hard stops, like a DJ set with sharp transitions, be ready for stumples and people leaving.

If you want to build up to a level of excellence, repeat what you do over and over, and you will get there.
