This week I'm in Sebastopol as a roadtrip stop, living on a beautiful farm with some really lovely people. I had the idea of filming a short video from the perspective of a bug, and make a remix of [this song from A Bug's Life](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zNXI-hoYnKg&ab_channel=RandyNewman-Topic) as the background music. üêúüêúüêú

### AI Explorations
As I was thinking about fun ways to remix this song, I started searching for AI remixing tools, and stumpled upon a search engine called [There's an AI for That](https://theresanaiforthat.com/s/music+remix/)

Through this rabbit hole, I found out about [Mark Doppler](https://www.markdoppler.com/), who made some wonderful webapps with AI generative tools. I tried prompting with the [texttomusic](https://www.texttomusic.app/) app, the result is great but a bit too short short.

I tried to find tools that specifically remixes songs instead of generate from scratch, since I already have the vision for A Bug's Life. I stumpled upon [this article that covered some pretty sweet audio & midi AI generative tool kits](https://midi.org/midi-articles/4-midi-generators-powered-by-machine-learning).

I found [Basic Pitch by Spotify ](https://basicpitch.spotify.com/)that turns audio to midi samples, so I put the song thru the webapp, the first result comes out to be kind of hectic because it was picking up all the accompanying instruments, it is hard to tell where the theme is.

So I put the downloaded mp3 into Ableton and added an EQ to single out the main theme. There are still a bunch of random notes but this time at least the main theme is legible!

### Ableton
When I imported the midi file into Ableton and gave it a Mallet sound, it sounds good but you can't really tell the original melody, and it would be a lot of manual editing work to get the original tune to be separated.

So I decided to grab my midi keyboard and just play the tune, since it's simple enough for my ear to catch.

In the end, I used MIDI file from Basic Pitch by Spotify as strings in the background, then played the theme with my own midi as a type of mallet for the main melody, added some crazy effects, pad transitions and then it's done!

## Videos
I put my phone on the ground level and took a lot of videos. Had to re-take some of the footage because the bugs just didn't look right.

## Challenge
Part of this weekly video challenge is to see how FAST can I create something and call it complete, yet it doesn't give me enough time to experiment with new techniques, read through longer documentations, since I'm working with a ticking clock and I'm always concerned of not finishing things on time.
Next week, I hope to make the video as minimal as possible, and experiment more with audio.
