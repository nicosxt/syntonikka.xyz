### Process
This week we got to San Francisco and stayed in the city. I thought it would be sweet to remix a song by some local bay area artists, after listening to some 'iconic' bay area songs, I found this song [Yay Area by E-40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1GfCLh_ye8&ab_channel=CA-manila) to be really banging ðŸŽ¶

So I downloaded the song, separated vocals and instruments with [Vocal Remover](https://vocalremover.org/), brought it to Ableton and converted the instruments to a drum kit, then remixed it in Ableton with some automated reverbs, echo delays, EQ fading and additional samples.

The track turned out to be pretty neat~ ðŸ˜Ž

I used a bunch of video footage from hanging out at the Alemany farmers market, and a stroll around the Golden Gate Bridge Park. Then used [Eden.Art](https://eden.art/)'s real2real feature to lerp between the footages to create the 'trippy' visual lerping effects as a frame transition.

Shout out to Eden for making stable diffusion so easy and convenient to use! ðŸŽ‰

### Learnings
Using the Real2real feature is definitely a great way to create intense and imaginary visual impact. As I tried to compress all these random footages into one video, it does feel a bit too much content. For next week's video I'd like to experiment with a more focused theme of footages, maybe just a bagel and play around with camera angels a bit more.
