**The Less You Want The More You Have**

I've been feeling a mental transformation lately, it's been kind of surreal and incredible.

I'm very grateful for the things I've created and relationships I've built, I feel content and at peace with the present, and generally excited and motivated to build a better future for myself and the community around me.

I don't know how long this state of mind will last, and I'm not sure how I got here. I definitely had many mental struggles and probably will have more struggles in the future, but I'm grateful for this deeply peaceful yet energizing state of mind.

The fundamental realization that caused this mental transformation can be summarized to: awareness and acceptance.

### Awareness

> Drugs, food, news, gambling, shopping, gaming, texting, sexting, Facebooking, Instagramming, YouTubing, tweeting . . . The smartphone is the modern-day hypodermic needle, delivering digital dopamine 24/7 for a wired generation.

I catch myself scatterbrained all the time, where I'd open my computer, and suddenly got distracted by 20 things and forgot what I wanted to do.

I realized this kind of scattered-ness is really non conducive for my life and my work. I would forget important things, I would accidentally break expensive devices, burn whatever I was cooking, call people by the wrong name, miss highway exits... from trivial mundane things to life-threatening mistakes, not paying attention and being easily distracted in general became a destructive force in my life.

The classic treatment for this is meditation and other mindful practices, where I do find those helpful at times, I don't think there's a one-size treat-all formula. Everyone's gotta try out what works for them in the end.

Here are the things that worked for me:
- Walking in nature.
	- Being in Portland and living next to a piece of wild forest has been incredible. I can walk out every morning, smell the trees and touch the ground with my feet, that feels incredible, and I feel encouraged to just create space of emptiness to not worry much about the far future, and just enjoy the present moment.
- Flow
	- Flow with my physical body requires a certain level of mental focus. I have to pay attention when learning a new skateboarding trick, otherwise I fall hard on the ground. Just walking or running, bicycling, skating, or 
- Phone Practice
	- Browsing on the phone to procrastinate is jut a very mind numbing, low effort constantly going dopamine hit. I find it very non-constructive to what I want to do, and energetically 'trapped' where it makes me feel less alive than I want to be. 
	- In order to feel better, I start to catch myself every time I fall into the state of mindless browsing, every time I catch myself I'd stop and go do anything else.
	- After successfully catching myself a few times and stop to do something else that made me feel more alive, I began to feel empowered, rewarded and proud. I feel that I have the agency to steer my own life, not succumb to what these content machines are telling me to do, because I realized that I know what I want better than them. I have the power to choose where I dedicate my energy into, and protect myself from outside influences that don't have my best interest at heart.
- Mindful Eating

### Acceptance

Another big mental shift that helped me reaching this stage is a gentle acceptance towards who I am.

I've struggled with this a lot since a child. I never felt like pretty enough, smart enough, lovable enough to do the things I wanted to do. I have big ambitious dreams and just felt like I could never get there.

Maybe it's a combination of a suppressed ego and harsh learning environment, I got into a habit of forcing myself to adapt to hard things, mostly to prove to myself that I am smart and capable.

I would sit in front of the computer for hours to try to figure out some really hard program or math and feel very frustrated that I am not as smart as I want to be.

Finally finally recently, I began to accept who I am, and where I am. I realize that I am just not gonna be a genius like some people, there are things that I may not be good at, but that's ok, because we are a society and we are supposed to work together. And I should be patient with myself, allow time and space for growth.

It really is a balance of giving my ego enough space to shine, enough recognition and encouragement so that it has capacity to create space for collaboration with the greater communities. Then would it have the capacity to be patient for greater things in the future.

If I don't acknowledge these needs from the ego, then the suppressed ego would just cause insecurities, jealous, and all other unbalanced emotions.

In summary, acceptance includes:
- Acknowledge your imperfections and shortcomings
- Acknowledge your strength and expertise
- Most importantly, acknowledge your beauty
- Then acknowledge the beauty of people all around you
- Be patient about your growth, and understand that you are the master of your own reality.
- Accept all your ideas, but also accept that they might change, that others might disagree.
- Accept that you are not where you want to be yet, be patient, and leave room for growth.
- Accept your ego, accept you, so that you can start to accept everything that happens to you, and everyone around you.

### Empowerment

As of late, dining had become a sanctuary for me—a retreat from the strain and tedium of work's relentless march. Yet, the constant recourse to this refuge led to an unsettling overindulgence, an imbalance in my relationship with food.

I yearned to tame my compulsions, to foster a healthier accord with food. Despite some progress, I'd often backslide into excessive eating. It wasn't until I redefined **abstinence as a form of empowerment** that the narrative began to change.

Choosing not to eat became a tangible testament to my ability to master my desires, a clear assertion of my self-control. 

When accompanied by the practice of mindful consumption, my dining experiences took on new dimensions. I began to truly savor every aspect of a meal—from the burst of flavors to the tantalizing aromas, from the nurturing components to the sacred ritual of dining itself. I also started to pay attention to how my body responded post-meal, and found value in the sensation of hunger. It wasn't comfortable, but it was strengthening, much like a tough mountain climb.

By confining my eating to specific windows, and meticulously portioning my meals, I've been able to recalibrate my relationship with food. This discipline only heightened the significance of each meal.

Portion control, served in a small bowl, made each meal a celebration of sorts. I felt accomplished after consuming a well-measured serving, knowing that I had not overindulged. Occasional indulgence was permitted, but always within the bounds of health.

In summary, my cravings have reduced significantly, and my relationship with food is more thoughtful and intentional. I now savor every flavor and enjoy my meals more. This journey has made me feel empowered and confident, in full command of my eating habits and all other aspects of life.
