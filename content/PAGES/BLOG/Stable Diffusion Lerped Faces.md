I had an idea to LERP faces across species using Real2Real provided by [Eden.Art](https://eden.art/).

I started off collecting front facing pictures of animal and my faces, cropped them in Photoshop to the same size.

Then I ran a lerp between my face and each of the animal faces, the results are pretty interesting, an example below:

I took screenshots at some great in-betweens of the lerped video. Here are some highlights:

Then I continued to lerp between the faces above.
