I had an idea to LERP faces across species using Real2Real provided by [Eden.Art](https://eden.art/).

I started off collecting front facing pictures of animal and my faces, cropped them in Photoshop to the same size.

Then I ran a lerp between my face and each of the animal faces, the results are pretty interesting, an example below:

I took screenshots at some great in-betweens of the lerped video. Here are some highlights:

Then I continued to lerp between the faces above, and the result is lovely!

Some of my favorites:

![[ASSETS/ART/SD_Faces/sdf2.png]]
![[ASSETS/ART/SD_Faces/sdf3.png]]
![[ASSETS/ART/SD_Faces/sdf4.png]]

I did go ahead and tried to lerp these images, the result is somewhat interesting but I'm still mostly very satisfied with the images above.

See videos of the third lerp:

This was a fun little experiment, thank you for reading!
