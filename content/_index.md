# Building Protopias ⚖️
>The term "Protopia" was first used by Kevin Kelly, co-founder of Wired Magazine, to describe a state of becoming, a gradual improvement which is not utopian (perfect) or dystopian (horribly wrong), but a continuous process of betterment.

### BB Home
Recently I acquired a piece of land in Bombay Beach, California. It has 2 abandoned trailers and some workshop spaces. The land is run-down and desolated.
I'd love to turn this space to a co-living sanctuary and creative space. Read more at: [[PAGES/SUBPAGES/BBHome|BBHome]]

### Mars College
[Mars College](https://mars.college/) is an artist residency & coliving community on the theme of radical self reliance, desert uniwheel riding, van life constructing and local knowledge exchange at the intersection of art and technology. It is where you'll possibly find me at least 25% time of the year.
