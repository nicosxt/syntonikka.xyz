### Protopia Building ‚öñÔ∏è
>The term "Protopia" was first used by Kevin Kelly, co-founder of Wired Magazine, to describe a state of becoming, a gradual improvement which is not utopian (perfect) or dystopian (horribly wrong), but a continuous process of betterment.

*These projects represent my effort to create and support Protopias. ü´ß*
