I thought it would be sweet to remix a song by some local bay area artists, after listening to some 'iconic' bay area songs, I found this song [Yay Area by E-40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1GfCLh_ye8\u0026ab_channel=CA-manila) to be really banging üé∂\n\nSo I downloaded the song, separated vocals and instruments with [Vocal Remover](https://vocalremover.org/), brought it to Ableton and converted the instruments to a drum kit, then remixed it in Ableton with some automated reverbs, echo delays, EQ fading and additional samples.\n![[ASSETS/WeeklyVideos/E40-ableton.png]]\n\nThe track turned out to be pretty neat~ üòé\n![[ASSETS/WeeklyVideos/05-21-SF.wav]]\n\nI used a bunch of video footage from hanging out at the Alemany farmers market, and a stroll around the Golden Gate Bridge Park. Then used [Eden.Art](https://eden.art/)'s real2real feature to lerp between the footages to create the 'trippy' visual lerping effects as a frame transition.\n\nShout out to Eden for making stable diffusion so easy and convenient to use! üéâ\n\n### Learnings\nUsing the Real2real feature is definitely a great way to create intense and imaginary visual impact. As I tried to compress all these random footages into one video, it does feel a bit too much content. For next week's video I'd like to experiment with a more focused theme of footages, maybe just a bagel and play around with camera angels a bit more.","lastmodified":"2023-05-21T17:19:22.480730903Z","tags":[]},"/PAGES/BLOG/World-Building":{"title":"World Building","content":"A fun person to explore and to read:\n- http://iancheng.com/\n\n#### Hi Mom our simulations are creating simulations!\n\nScenes:\nSuccession, season 4 ep 1 Logan's monologue about markets\nWestworld\nsimcity, city skylines, 30 years of playing god\n\n\n#### Worlds inside our little brains\n\nInternal family system, psychologies and how they can be visualized in 3D recognizable items, Astor visualized with metaphors?\n\nMulri-personality 'disorders' ---- internal family systems ---- all these personas we have, the origins of our thoughts\n\nThe extremes, yin and yang of personalities, and we dance among everything in between.\n\nWhat is a 'world'.
