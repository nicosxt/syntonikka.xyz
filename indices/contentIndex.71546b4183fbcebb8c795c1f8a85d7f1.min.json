I definitely had many mental struggles and probably will have more struggles in the future, but I'm grateful for this deeply peaceful yet energizing state of mind.\n\nThe fundamental realization that caused this mental transformation can be summarized to: awareness and acceptance.\n\n### Awareness\n\n\u003e Drugs, food, news, gambling, shopping, gaming, texting, sexting, Facebooking, Instagramming, YouTubing, tweeting¬†.¬†.¬†. The smartphone is the modern-day hypodermic needle, delivering digital dopamine 24/7 for a wired generation.\n\nI catch myself scatterbrained all the time, where I'd open my computer, and suddenly got distracted by 20 things and forgot what I wanted to do.\n\nI realized this kind of scattered-ness is really non conducive for my life and my work. I would forget important things, I would accidentally break expensive devices, burn whatever I was cooking, call people by the wrong name, miss highway exits... from trivial mundane things to life-threatening mistakes, not paying attention and being easily distracted in general became a destructive force in my life.\n\nThe classic treatment for this is meditation and other mindful practices, where I do find those helpful at times, I don't think there's a one-size treat-all formula. Everyone's gotta try out what works for them in the end.\n\nHere are the things that worked for me:\n- Walking in nature.\n\t- Being in Portland and living next to a piece of wild forest has been incredible. I can walk out every morning, smell the trees and touch the ground with my feet, that feels incredible, and I feel encouraged to just create space of emptiness to not worry much about the far future, and just enjoy the present moment.\n- Flow\n\t- Flow with my physical body requires a certain level of mental focus. I have to pay attention when learning a new skateboarding trick, otherwise I fall hard on the ground. Just walking or running, bicycling, skating, or \n- Phone Practice\n\t- Browsing on the phone to procrastinate is jut a very mind numbing, low effort constantly going dopamine hit. I find it very non-constructive to what I want to do, and energetically 'trapped' where it makes me feel less alive than I want to be. \n\t- In order to feel better, I start to catch myself every time I fall into the state of mindless browsing, every time I catch myself I'd stop and go do anything else.\n\t- After successfully catching myself a few times and stop to do something else that made me feel more alive, I began to feel empowered, rewarded and proud. I feel that I have the agency to steer my own life, not succumb to what these content machines are telling me to do, because I realized that I know what I want better than them. I have the power to choose where I dedicate my energy into, and protect myself from outside influences that don't have my best interest at heart.\n- Mindful Eating\n\n### Acceptance\n\nAnother big mental shift that helped me reaching this stage is a gentle acceptance towards who I am.\n\nI've struggled with this a lot since a child. I never felt like pretty enough, smart enough, lovable enough to do the things I wanted to do. I have big ambitious dreams and just felt like I could never get there.\n\nMaybe it's a combination of a suppressed ego and harsh learning environment, I got into a habit of forcing myself to adapt to hard things, mostly to prove to myself that I am smart and capable.\n\nI would sit in front of the computer for hours to try to figure out some really hard program or math and feel very frustrated that I am not as smart as I want to be.\n\nFinally finally recently, I began to accept who I am, and where I am. I realize that I am just not gonna be a genius like some people, there are things that I may not be good at, but that's ok, because we are a society and we are supposed to work together. And I should be patient with myself, allow time and space for growth.\n\nIt really is a balance of giving my ego enough space to shine, enough recognition and encouragement so that it has capacity to create space for collaboration with the greater communities. Then would it have the capacity to be patient for greater things in the future.\n\nIf I don't acknowledge these needs from the ego, then the suppressed ego would just cause insecurities, jealous, and all other unbalanced emotions.\n\nIn summary, acceptance includes:\n- Acknowledge your imperfections and shortcomings\n- Acknowledge your strength and expertise\n- Most importantly, acknowledge your beauty\n- Then acknowledge the beauty of people all around you\n- Be patient about your growth, and understand that you are the master of your own reality.\n- Accept all your ideas, but also accept that they might change, that others might disagree.\n- Accept that you are not where you want to be yet, be patient, and leave room for growth.\n- Accept your ego, accept you, so that you can start to accept everything that happens to you, and everyone around you.\n\n### Empowerment\n\nAs of late, dining had become a sanctuary for me‚Äîa retreat from the strain and tedium of work's relentless march. Yet, the constant recourse to this refuge led to an unsettling overindulgence, an imbalance in my relationship with food.\n\nI yearned to tame my compulsions, to foster a healthier accord with food. Despite some progress, I'd often backslide into excessive eating. It wasn't until I redefined **abstinence as a form of empowerment** that the narrative began to change.\n\nChoosing not to eat became a tangible testament to my ability to master my desires, a clear assertion of my self-control. \n\nWhen accompanied by the practice of mindful consumption, my dining experiences took on new dimensions. I began to truly savor every aspect of a meal‚Äîfrom the burst of flavors to the tantalizing aromas, from the nurturing components to the sacred ritual of dining itself. I also started to pay attention to how my body responded post-meal, and found value in the sensation of hunger. It wasn't comfortable, but it was strengthening, much like a tough mountain climb.\n\nBy confining my eating to specific windows, and meticulously portioning my meals, I've been able to recalibrate my relationship with food. This discipline only heightened the significance of each meal.\n\nPortion control, served in a small bowl, made each meal a celebration of sorts. I felt accomplished after consuming a well-measured serving, knowing that I had not overindulged. Occasional indulgence was permitted, but always within the bounds of health.\n\nIn summary, my cravings have reduced significantly, and my relationship with food is more thoughtful and intentional. I now savor every flavor and enjoy my meals more. This journey has made me feel empowered and confident, in full command of my eating habits and all other aspects of life.","lastmodified":"2024-01-24T03:59:39.838619345Z","tags":[]},"/PAGES/BLOG/Repetition":{"title":"Repetition","content":"\nRepetition creates consistency\nRepetition creates a trans state of consciousness\nRepetition creates stairs that build up to greater work\nRepetition composes essential parts of life\n\nWhen you move to a new city, a lot of things have to start over, relationships, companions, know-how and know-what.\nSame with starting a new career, a new hobby, you have to inevitably stumble or slow down before you can accelerate.\n\nIn order to accelerate to a higher speed, familiarity is required, familiarity comes from consistency, consistency comes from repetition.\n\nOne two, one two, just keep going.\n\nEvery time you abaondon a hobby, a place, a relationship, a job, everything has to be re-set.

To tackle this, I introduce Little Marvi, a character designed to encourage mindful resource usage through engaging Public Service Announcements (PSAs). Little Marvi, an extension of the Little Martians universe by #va2rosa, showcases Martians performing responsible actions around Mars. Users can request an image and personalize these messages using a simple, ready to print, Google Slides template. This initiative aligns with the Hackathon's \"Worlding\" theme by building on the existing Little Martians world and enhancing our IRL world's sustainable practices in a fun, relatable manner. Conclusion: With the help of Little Marvi, we can create fun art that inspires a more mindful culture at Mars College.\nEden Link: [https://app.eden.art/concepts/65ac75772517b09fa0cd3736](https://app.eden.art/concepts/65ac75772517b09fa0cd3736) [https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1xlut8DTqxsusZKgi_kdDvahr2AMhkyqc_YPkCGRpMDQ/edit?usp=sharing](https://app.eden.art/concepts/65ac75772517b09fa0cd3736)","lastmodified":"2024-01-24T03:59:39.838619345Z","tags":[]},"/PAGES/MARS/Mars.Sim":{"title":"Mars.Sim","content":"A little Simulation game aiming to be digital twin of Mars College 2024\n\nHere are some [[PAGES/MARS/Messy Notes on Simulations|Messy Notes on Simulations]] that I wrote down over the years, working on consolidating them into a statement","lastmodified":"2024-01-24T03:59:39.838619345Z","tags":[]},"/PAGES/MARS/Messy-Notes-on-Simulations":{"title":"Messy Notes on Simulations","content":"**WHY**\nThrough simulating a world, we discover how our world is built, this is the beauty of engineering, because our world is also engineered.\n\nGames are simulations that are abstracted from our natural systems at large.

It is fun to play\n2. It sounds amazing\n3. It invents things that haven't been invented before.\n\n### Getting Started\nHave fallen victim of an infinite scope creep, I've learned lessons of having massive goals and never finishing it, now it doesn't mean that it cannot evolve to be complex, but the basics need to be simple enough so I can launch it all on my own.\n\nI can make sequencers, random physical instruments, a bicycle that sings, a building that sings, everything in this game can have their own rules and principles of making sounds, the sky is the limit!\n\nEventually it can be a sandbox where player gets to drag and drop any instrument to the scene to make their own 'singing city', but first, maybe we focus on making just one.\n\n### Sequencer\nI think the sequencer is a good starting point, because it is easy enough to make and fun already. Although a sequencer doesn't have interesting functions such as ambient pad or dynamic vocal or cool synth effects, it's fun enough on its own. This my first iteration of a sequencer with singing agents.\n![[ASSETS/GAMES/sequencerview.jpg]]\n\nSee full gameplay here.\nhttps://twitter.com/syntonikka/status/1681429189684236288?s=20\nIt is very tempting to want to expand already and play around with something more experimental, advanced, etc... but I need to remind myself: **STAY FOCUSED**\n\n### Long Term Goal\nThe keyword here is a musical sandbox, it's a sandbox that you can drag and drop and customize, allowing user to create a world of possibilities. Each instrument has their unique capabilities, such as the sequencer, or maybe an apple tree, or maybe who knows, a bicycle rider rolling around hills, or a skate park, anyways... any of these things can be instruments, and player gets to pick them, choose and edit them, in the end put them all together in a scene to make music.\n\n---\n### Simplifying Goal -- Just an AR sequencer\nNow the vision has become more clear: an AR sequencer app.\nWhat we're eliminating:\n- instruments other than sequenced beats (no pads, no melody yet)\n- other experimental instruments.\nAR is still a niche and an AR sequencer hasn't been created yet.\n\n### UI/UX in Augmented Reality\nOnce goal has been simplified, we can move forward with a much clearer direction.\nBecause it is in AR, UI interactions would be different from a standalone or even mobile experience.\n##### Functional buttons in screen space\nit is not necessary for user to click a button in AR space, especially when the button needs to be functional, it's just too inconvenient and unnecessary.\n##### Playful interactions in AR space\nWhat's special about AR is that it interacts with the environment, user can choose to place the sequencer in real world and see the visuals in real-life space, which is a very one-of-a-kind experience that only AR apps can offer. This would be the special 'cookie' of the game.\n\n----\n### Change of Direction - No Need for AR Game\nI've encountered some problems incorporating AR mechanism into the game, mostly the documentation is scarce, I don't have enough engineering knowledge to understand it, and most importantly, I couldn't find enough tutorials online that cover this extensively.\n\nUnity is using XR toolkit for both AR and VR interactions now, but I can barely find any tutorials specific to AR unless they are from 3 years ago. That got me thinking:\n\nDo people even play AR games?\n\nAnd the answer is very obvious -- no, people do not play AR games, not saying that it shouldn't be made, but the majority of mobile games is NOT AR.\n\nSo I decided on a change of direction: instead of AR games, focus on the sequencing, sound and visuals of the game, and just publish it. It doesn't even need to be 3D. It could just be a fun little interface!\n\n**So here's the new strategy:**\n- no AR, no 3D for now\n- focus on UI\n- make it sound amazing and really fun!\n\n-----\n### Things that inspired me along the way‚ú®\n![[Screenshot 2023-07-20 at 1.31.45 PM.png]]","lastmodified":"2024-01-24T03:59:39.838619345Z","tags":[]},"/PAGES/SUBPAGES/GAMES/Pocket-Beats/Pocket-Beats-Privacy-Policy":{"title":"Pocket Beats Privacy Policy","content":"Last updated: November 27, 2023\n\nThis Privacy Policy describes Our policies and procedures on the collection, use and disclosure of Your information when You use the Service and tells You about Your privacy rights and how the law protects You.\n## Interpretation and Definitions\n\n### Interpretation\n\nThe words of which the initial letter is capitalized have meanings defined under the following conditions.
